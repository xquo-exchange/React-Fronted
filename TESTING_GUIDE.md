## Phase 2: Initial Load Test (1 minute)

### Step 2.1: Refresh the Page
Press `F5` or `Ctrl + R` to refresh the app

### Step 2.2: Watch Console Logs (First 10 seconds)
You should see logs appearing. Look for:

**✅ GOOD logs (RPC initialization):**
```
🔄 CurveContext: Initializing Curve in RPC mode...
🔄 CurveContext: Trying RPC: https://rpc.ankr.com/eth/...
✅ CurveContext: RPC initialized with https://rpc.ankr.com/eth/...
🔄 CurveContext: Fetching pools...
✅ CurveContext: Curve ready!
```

**❌ BAD logs (these mean something is wrong):**
```
Cannot access "buffer.Buffer"
❌ CurveContext: Initialization failed
TypeError: Provider is undefined
```

**📝 Take a screenshot** if you see anything red/orange

### Step 2.3: Check if You See the Landing Page
- Should show "Connect wallet to continue" message
- Should show "Connect Wallet" button
- Should NOT show the Swap/Stake interface yet

✅ **If YES → Continue to Phase 3**
❌ **If NO or errors → Screenshot and share errors**

---

## Phase 3: Wallet Connection Test (3-5 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Clear Console Again
Before you click anything, clear the console so it's easier to see new logs

### Step 3.2: Click "Connect Wallet" Button
Click the big blue button that says "Connect Wallet"

### Step 3.3: Watch Console Logs (First 5 seconds)
**Look for this sequence:**

```
✅ EXPECTED LOG SEQUENCE:

1. 🔗 Initializing WalletConnect...
2. 🔗 WalletConnect: Initializing provider...
3. 🔗 WalletConnect: Provider created, enabling connection...
4. ✅ WalletConnect: Provider enabled successfully
5. ✅ Wallet connected: 0x[your wallet address]
6. 🔄 CurveContext: Wallet connected, initializing Web3 mode...
7. ✅ CurveContext: Web3 Curve instance initialized
8. ✅ CurveContext: Web3 transaction mode ready!
```

### Step 3.4: Check for Modal
**A WalletConnect QR code modal should appear.** It will show:
- A QR code
- A list of wallet options (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Rainbow, etc.)

✅ **If modal appeared → This means the fix worked!**
❌ **If NO modal → Screenshot console and share**

### Step 3.5: Choose Your Wallet
Click on your wallet from the list (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)

### Step 3.6: Approve Connection in Your Wallet
- Your wallet app will ask to approve the connection
- Click "Approve" or "Connect" in your wallet
- (This happens in MetaMask extension, mobile wallet, etc.)

### Step 3.7: Watch Console Again
After approval, look for:
```
✅ More logs should appear:

9. 🔄 Accounts changed: [0xyour address]
10. 🔄 Chain changed: 0x1
11. ✅ Auto-connecting wallet...
```

✅ **If these logs appear → Connection succeeded!**

---

## Phase 4: Success Verification (1 minute)

### Step 4.1: Check if Interface Changed
**Before connection:**
- See GalaxyLanding page
- See "Connect wallet to continue" message
- See "Connect Wallet" button

**After connection:**
- Page should change
- Should see Navbar at top
- Should see Sidebar with "Swap" and "Deposit" buttons
- Should see main Swap or Deposit interface

✅ **If interface changed → FIX WORKS!**

### Step 4.2: Check Browser Console Errors
Scroll through console and look for:

**❌ RED errors** (show me these if present)
```
Uncaught Error: ...
TypeError: ...
Cannot access...
```

**⚠️ YELLOW warnings** (these are usually okay)
```
Warning: Received...
Deprecated API...
```

### Step 4.3: Check if Buttons Work
- Click on "Deposit" tab → should switch pages
- Click on "Swap" tab → should switch back
- Should see the page transition animation

✅ **If tabs switch → Everything works!**

## Phase 6: The Transaction Test (Optional - Advanced)

### Step 6.1: Try a Swap (if interface loaded)
1. Click on "Swap" tab

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Scenario 1: "buffer.Buffer" Error Still Appears

# In terminal:
Ctrl + C  # Stop dev server
npm run dev  # Restart
# Then refresh browser (F5)
```

### Scenario 2: WalletConnect Modal Never Appears
```
Check console for:
- "🔗 Initializing WalletConnect..." log?
  YES → Modal should appear soon (wait 10 seconds)
  NO → WalletConnect not initializing. Check RPC endpoints.
  
- Red error about RPC?
  YES → Network issue. Try switching to home WiFi or different network.
  NO → Unknown issue. Share console screenshot.
```

### Scenario 3: Connected but Web3 Transaction Mode Fails
```
Console should show:
"❌ CurveContext: Web3 initialization failed: [error message]"

Share the [error message] with me and I can debug.
```

### Scenario 4: Page Changed but Can't Click Buttons
```
This usually means JavaScript error. Check console for red errors.
Share any red errors with me.
```
