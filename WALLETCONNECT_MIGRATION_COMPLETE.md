# WalletConnect Migration - Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully migrated X-QUO DeFi platform from MetaMask-only to WalletConnect v2, enabling universal wallet support across desktop and mobile devices.

---

## What Changed

### 1. **New Dependencies Added**
- `@walletconnect/ethereum-provider@^2.11.0` - Core WalletConnect SDK

### 2. **New Files Created**
- `src/utils/walletconnectProvider.js` - WalletConnect initialization utility
  - Project ID: `88686807816516c396fdf733fd957d95`
  - Configured for Ethereum mainnet (chain: 1)
  - Enables QR modal for desktop connections
  - Supports deep linking for mobile

### 3. **Files Modified**

#### **src/contexts/WalletContext.jsx** - Complete Rewrite
**Before:** MetaMask extension-only, `window.ethereum` dependent
**After:** WalletConnect provider with universal wallet support

**Key Changes:**
- Removed `isMetaMaskInstalled` state (no longer needed)
- Added `walletConnectProvider` state for WC provider instance
- `connectWallet()` now uses `initWalletConnect()` instead of `window.ethereum`
- Event listeners updated to WalletConnect events: `accountsChanged`, `chainChanged`, `disconnect`, `session_delete`
- Exposes provider to `window.walletConnectProvider` for cross-context access
- Maintains localStorage persistence for auto-reconnection
- All balance checking and approval functions unchanged (work with ethers provider)

#### **src/contexts/CurveContext.jsx**
**Changes:**
- Removed `window.ethereum` dependency
- Now imports and uses `walletConnectProvider` from WalletContext
- Falls back to JsonRpc mode if no wallet connected
- Reinitializes when wallet connects (dependency on `walletConnectProvider`)

#### **src/contexts/PoolContext.jsx**
**Changes:**
- Replaced `window.ethereum` with `window.walletConnectProvider`
- Accesses WC provider from window object (set by WalletContext)
- Maintains Web3/RPC dual mode operation

#### **src/components/GalaxyLanding.jsx**
**Before:** Mobile detection, "Mobile Not Supported" message, MetaMask installation checks
**After:** Universal connection, works on all devices

**Removed:**
- `isMobile` state and mobile detection
- `error` state for MetaMask installation
- "Mobile Not Supported" UI elements
- Platform-specific button disabling

**Result:** Single "Connect Wallet" button that works everywhere

#### **src/components/Navbar.jsx**
**Changes:**
- Removed `isMetaMaskInstalled` from wallet context
- Button text: "Connect MetaMask" → "Connect Wallet"
- All other functionality unchanged (network switching, disconnect, etc.)

#### **src/components/StakeBox.jsx**
**Changes:**
- Added `walletConnectProvider` from useWallet hook
- Replaced `window.ethereum` checks with `walletConnectProvider`
- Uses `new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(walletConnectProvider)` for transactions
- All staking/withdrawal logic unchanged

#### **src/components/SwapInterface.jsx**
**Changes:**
- Added `walletConnectProvider` from useWallet hook
- Replaced `window.ethereum` checks with `walletConnectProvider`
- Uses WalletConnect provider for all swap transactions
- All swap logic, routes, and calculations unchanged

- Google Analytics tracking
- UI/UX design and styling

## Technical Architecture

### Provider Flow
```
User clicks "Connect"
    ↓
initWalletConnect() creates EthereumProvider
    ↓
Provider exposed to window.walletConnectProvider
    ↓
ethers.providers.Web3Provider wraps WC provider
    ↓
Used by Curve, Swap, Stake components
    ↓
All transactions flow through WC provider
```

### Event Handling
```
WalletConnect Events → WalletContext handlers → State updates → UI updates
- accountsChanged → Update address, trigger re-render
- chainChanged → Update chainId, reload page
- disconnect/session_delete → Clear state, show landing page
```

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - No errors, no warnings
✅ **Linting Clean** - All files pass ESLint
✅ **Production Ready** - Fully bundled and optimized
